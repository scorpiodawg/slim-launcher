# Slim launcher with PIN-protected Options menu

This is a fork of [SlimLauncher](https://github.com/sduduzog/slim-launcher) but with support
for PIN locking the options menu. This is useful for simple scenarios where changing
the Apps the user can launch should not be editable except by an "admin" such as a kid's
phone.
